## Introduction
GroundingGPT is an end-to-end multimodal grounding model that accurately comprehends inputs and possesses robust grounding capabilities across multi modalities,including images, audios, and videos. To address the issue of limited data, we construct a diverse and high-quality multimodal training dataset. This dataset encompasses a rich collection of multimodal data enriched with spatial and temporal information, thereby serving as a valuable resource to foster further advancements in this field. Extensive experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of the GroundingGPT model in understanding and grounding tasks across various modalities. 

More details are available in our [project page](https://lzw-lzw.github.io/GroundingGPT.github.io/).
